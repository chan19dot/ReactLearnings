Services are to manage all api requests. 
You can see them as a bridge or an adapter between the database server APIs and the view layer (pages and components) of our application.

It will take care of all the network calls of our app.

All data requests are defined here, and response data is transformed and served. 
In some cases it can also be saved in the redux store.


The pages and components may dispatch actions, read the store and update themselves based on the data changes.
They may access the services directly if it doesnâ€™t need to be added to the redux store.
Actions will use services for backend connectivity. Thunk is a redux middleware used to handle asynchronous actions and side-effects.
